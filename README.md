This project aims to build an AI model capable of recognizing eight basic facial emotions:

😊 Happiness

😡 Anger

😱 Fear

😢 Sadness

😐 Neutral

🤮 Disgust

😒 Contempt

😲 Surprise

The system uses grayscale facial images, preprocesses them, extracts the most meaningful features using LDA, and classifies emotions using SVM.
This project is suitable for real-time emotion analysis, sentiment-aware applications, mental-health monitoring, and human–computer interaction systems.
📌 Key Features
